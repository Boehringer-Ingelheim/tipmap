Description: Tipping point analysis for clinical trials that employ
    Bayesian dynamic borrowing via robust meta-analytic predictive (MAP)
    priors. Further functions facilitate expert elicitation of a primary
    weight of the informative component of the robust MAP prior and
    computation of operating characteristics. Intended use is the
    planning, analysis and interpretation of extrapolation studies in
    pediatric drug development, but applicability is generally wider.
